###What is going on with these tests?###
Can use **jUnit** on it's own to unit test stuff

Can use **Mockito** to mock some things but comes apart when using Android classes like JSONObject and do some feature testing.

Can use **Robolectric** to scaffold the whole app with resources and assets without needing to mock things.
